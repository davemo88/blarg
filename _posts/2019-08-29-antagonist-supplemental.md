To be a strong climber and stay injury free, it is important to do antagonist training, i.e. to train the muscles in opposition to the muscles which are used heavily in climbing but are not heavily used themselves. Generally, these are the pushing muscles of the upper body, e.g. the triceps, the pectorals, and even the lats.

First and most importantly - the forearm muscles. The most important group of muscles for climbing are the finger flexor muscles in the forearm. However, as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiOp3hxJVkw), the finger extensor muscles are also engaged as stabilizers during finger flexion.
